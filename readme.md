Lessons for Adam
======

###Lesson 1
- Download the github git client
- Clone this repo
- Make a new branch called "hello world"
- Add a file called index.html
- Inside that file type `hello world`
- Commit that file
- Push that branch
- Make a pull request

You won't know how to do all of this, it's your job to google it.
Good luck
